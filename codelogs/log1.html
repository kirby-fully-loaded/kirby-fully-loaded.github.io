	<h1>Code Log 1: HTML Semantic Tags</h1>

    <p>The difference between semantic and nonsemantic HTML tags is that semantic tags state what is contained within them in clear language. </p>

    <p>Some examples of semantic HTML tags include:</p>

    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><code><header></code></li>
            <li><code><body></code></li>
            <li><code><footer></code></li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>See how each of these examples is a clear English word, rather than an opaque or confusing piece of "computer” language?</p>

    <p>
        Among the benefits of semantic tags are human-legibility and organization. By using human-legible language, these tags allow coders to gain an understanding of which section of a page is contained within each tag with just a glance. Even those who aren't experienced with coding language can infer the content of these tags based on their names. This also aids in communication between coders and noncoders, if one needs to relay basic coding fixes through speech or text; the use of basic English words for these tags improves the likelihood that a layperson can input code without getting overwhelmed by technical terms. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Similarly, the use of semantic tags makes code organization easier. To use the examples from the list above, it's easy to infer, even with no prior knowledge, that a header should be at the top, a body should be in the middle, and a footer should be at the bottom, just like a letter, a page of an essay, or even just the human body!
