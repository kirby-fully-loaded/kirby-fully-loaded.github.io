    <h1>CSS Media Queries</h1>
	<main>
        <h2>What is a media query?</h2>
        <p>
            A media query is a rule that tells a website how to display or behave when 
            a defined condition or set of conditions are met by a device or browser.
            Media queries do so by first checking for a type of medium, which can be "all",
            "print", or "screen", and then checking for a feature of that medium, such as
            one of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>width</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This determines the width of the viewport (not the device width),
                        which is particularly useful for both browsers (on desktops) and
                        for layouts designed for print.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>inverted-colors</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This determines whether the device or browser is using inverted colors;
                        it is useful for accessibility reasons, such as determining whether
                        a user has a color-based sight impairment, and would benefit from
                        appropriate accommodations.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>hover</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This feature determines whether the interface device is capable of hovering. 
                        This information is valuable for detecting whether a user is viewing the site 
                        on a touch-screen, which cannot hover, or whether they are using a keyboard or 
                        screen-reader. This information is valuable for both display considerations 
                        (for touchscreens) and for determining how to organize information (for 
                        both touchscreens and screen-readers).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <li>Orientation</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This determines whether a viewport, like a screen or a browser, is currently 
                        in either landscape or portrait display mode. This particular feature is 
                        useful in designing responsive websites, because it allows a site to change 
                        its display mode depending on the device's orientation, meaning a single 
                        page can display effectively on different device orientations, such as 
                        smartphones or desktop monitors.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Once a feature's properties have been determined, the site can alter how it behaves or displays
            content, such as changing layout based on portrait or landscape orientation, or reformatting
            tooltips if a device currently lacks the ability to hover. However, the designer decides what 
            a site does when receiving a positive response to its media query; the query only directs the site 
            according to the designer's code.
