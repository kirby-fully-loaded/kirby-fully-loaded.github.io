    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        The Pacific Rhododendron is found along the Pacific coast, from southern British Columbia to northern California,
        and from the Pacific Coast up to an elevation of 6,000 ft (1.8288 km) in the Cascades. Within Washington State,
        it is most commonly found in the forests of the Olympic Peninsula and the Cascade Mountains, where it comfortably
        coexists with its fellow native plants: the confiers making up the bulk of these forests.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Pacific Rhododendron was chosen as Washington's state flower in 1892, by a panel of about 15,000 Washingtonian
        women (men were not permitted to vote) so that Washington could be represented in the National Garland of Flowers
        exhibit for the Chicago World's Fair, to be held the following year. It remained the "de-facto" state flower until
        the decision was approved by the Washington Legislasture in 1949.
